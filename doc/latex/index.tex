\hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht} is a synthesizer engine targeting the fast and easy creation of Sound\+Units (aka synthesizers and audio effects) that run on most Unix/\+Linux machines.

More specifically \hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht} is targeting the Raspberry 3 computer. As such it is optimized to be used with the low computing power of this machine.

I am aiming at using the engine as part of teaching students in the field of digital media. As such, I am trying to design a system, that is generally understandable, does not require to much of a prior knowledge in audio programming, but still offers enough flexibilty and power to create interesting and expressive musical instruments and audio effects. Using the Raspberry 3 is part of this approach. I want the software to be running on cheap hardware allowing students to experiment without the need of having access to expensive fruity systems.

Installing \hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht} on your computer is done by taking the usual steps. The code is self contained, meaning all nessecary libraries are added to the source distribution of \hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht}.

In order to compile \hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht} you first compile the underlying libraries and, in a second step, compile \hyperlink{classNeonlicht}{Neonlicht} and the additional tools.
