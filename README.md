Welcome to Neonlicht


This software is not in any way a productive release! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT and /or compile on your computers.
It is unstable, not meant to be used, DANGEROUS, as it may harm your computer, your state of mind, your ears.

This repository is meant strictly for internal use. I need a place to do backups of my work.


Please: give me another one or two month. I will then release the software to the general public.
But not NOW !
